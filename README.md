Made use of the Mailchimp marketting API to create a Mailing List with Node-Js
the first branch involved building this out with the barebones Node.Js https module
after later realizing that Mailchimp created client libraries to interface with their APIs, I used
the Node-JS client library to rebuild in another branch
